# Microsoft Ignite 2019 - DevOps for Desktop Apps Demo
This is the demo application used in the Microsoft Ignite 2019 presentation: **Getting started with DevOps for .NET Windows desktop apps and Visual Studio App Center**. 

This application is used to demonstrate a simple and quick Azure DevOps Build Piepline with App Center integration. This application is based on the WPF Samples repository, specifically the [Calculator sample](https://github.com/microsoft/WPF-Samples/tree/master/Sample%20Applications/CalculatorDemo).

The Azure DevOps Project for this application (including Build Pipelines and status) is available [here](https://dajaco.visualstudio.com/Ignite2019).

## CI Status
